# Password_Generator
Project: Secure Password Generator
Description:
I created a secure password generator in Python that uses the 'random' and 'string' modules. This program helps generate strong and unique passwords by combining random characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols.
Features:
- Random Characters: Uses the 'random' module to select characters from the 'string' module.
- Enhanced Security: Shuffles characters to ensure unpredictability.
- Customizable:Allows users to set the password length and complexity.
- Easy to Use: Generates robust passwords to enhance online security.
This script is a versatile tool for creating unique and strong passwords tailored to specific needs, ensuring better protection for online accounts.
